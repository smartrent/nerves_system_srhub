# Post-installation firmware operations
#
# Tasks include:
#
# * `revert` - Revert to the previous firmware if it's still available
# * `factory-reset` - Clear out the writable filesystem and possibly other
#                     locations
# * `validate` - Mark this firmware as good
# * `prevent-revert` - Clear out the previous firmware slot
# * `status` - Print out which partition is active (`a` or `b`)
#
# To use:
#
# 1. Run `fwup -c -f fwup-opts.conf -o ops.fw` and copy ops.fw to
#    the device. This is done automatically as part of the Nerves system
#    build process. The file is stored in `/usr/share/fwup/ops.fw`.
# 2. On the device, run `fwup -t <task> ops.fw -d $NERVES_FW_DEVPATH`.
# 3. Reboot after running `revert` or `factory-reset`.
#
# It is critical that this is kept in sync with the main fwup.conf.

# Firmware metadata

# All of these can be overriden using environment variables of the same name.
#
#  Run 'fwup -m' to query values in a .fw file.
#  Use 'fw_printenv' to query values on the target.
#
# These are used by Nerves libraries to introspect.
